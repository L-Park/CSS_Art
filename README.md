# CSS_Art


HacktoberFest is an amazing opportunity to contribute to different repos to get a shirt and some stickers from GitHub and DigitalOcean. However, for the code to count we want to contribute some quality code. Therefore, the Hacksu team has created 5 different repos with 5 different skills to add some fun code to. Feel free to add whatever you want to the code to help make it better! Keep in mind that we control the repos and can see what you gets change so be cool :) 


For this repo, it is CSS art! We have three example animals but feel free to change the code! Change the colors of the animals see how it works! Also, if you have the time, add an animal!
